# Paternalmito
Analysis1:Tracking of posterior boundary of NMY-2::GFP and paternal mitochondria

We used a three-step analysis of time-lapse movie to track the average X coordinates (along the A-P axis) of paternal mitochondria and the X coordinates of the posterior boundary of NMY-2::GFP patches in each embryo.
